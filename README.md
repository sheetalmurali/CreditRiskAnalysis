# CreditRiskAnalysis
# R Studio
Implemented credit risk analysis using the 5 C’s framework: Credit history, Capacity, Capital, Conditions, and Collateral via exploratory data
analysis and correlation analysis. Utilized Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Ensemble methods, demonstrating Random Forest's robust
performance with an average cross-validation score of 86%, indicating strong generalization to new data. Applied findings to inform loan approval
decisions, prioritizing the 5 C’s framework to assess creditworthiness effectively.
